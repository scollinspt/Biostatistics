# Biostatistics for Clinical Research
## Theory & Applications in R

A book in development for the Biostatistics sequence of courses (1 & 2) at the University of Jamestown PhD in Clinical Research program. The book teaches and utilizes examples with the open source computational platform R  ( https://cran.r-project.org/). There is an emphasis and equal distribution of theory and application through all chapters. There is an underlying emphasis on performing all applications utilizing reproducible research approaches (programming with sufficient commentary) and tools (GitHub, Figshare, Open Science Framework, etc) throughout the book.

## Bookdown format

The bookdown format allows for the book to be shared while being developed and utilized in courses with minimal hassle and lots of end user options for reading. It is also easier to work with than a learning management system for interactive course assignments and activities. The book is based on the "minimal example" of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.
